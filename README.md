# POMODORO TIMER
The pomodoro-timer was made as an schoolproject, where I chose to use Golang as the coding language. It's a perfect time manager to work in intervals with little to no distraction. 
Clone the project and then write:
- `go run .` in your terminal to start the timer

WORK MODE is 25 minutes
PAUS TIME is 5 minutes

'Ctrl + C' to exit the program.

Good Luck!
